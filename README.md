## Spatial information contextualization for built heritage

The organization of information in historical building research and monument preservation plays a central role in drawing conclusions and gaining knowledge about the history of a building. During data acquisition, e.g. through building surveys, archival research and digitization, an accumulation of heterogeneous data of various types is created.
A 3D model with a high degree of detail as an information carrier, as in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process, is often not feasible during building research, because there are gaps in the information and the paradigms of the two processes are sometimes at odds with each other.
In order to enable the spatial contextualization of these data already during building research, this work addresses the question of how the heterogeneous data basis can be spatialized at an early stage without requiring a component-specific, time-intensive and, at this stage, often hypothetical modeling.
For this purpose, a method is proposed in which spatial data in the form of surface models from three-dimensional building surveys and drawings act as a reference system. This results in the challenge of transferring a building structure as an information container to an initially cluttered collection of points and two-dimensional representations in space.
The result is a prototypical application that allows an efficient, three-dimensional modeling of the building structure and facilitates the retrieval and query of the associated documents. By modeling a building structure with a spatially abstracted representation, the information system enables early and process-oriented integration and retrieval of linked information.
